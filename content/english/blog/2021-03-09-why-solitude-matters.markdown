I am in the room that was, before Covid, the guest room. The bed is gone and I'm sitting at my French-style wooden desk that I found at Restore and painted purple with Annie's Chalk paint. The upholstered chair under me also came from Restore, a perfect match for the desk, with Purple seat and back cushions added to make it comfie.

Out the window, a sunny midMarch day. Chickens are singing egg songs in their coop yard, winter birds playing tag between the copses. The Magic Tree, where my husband and I devoted ourselves to this place on our fifth anniversary, is framed by the window. It's a magic tree because every late-afternoon, the sun falls just right on it and it shines/gleams.

My body is literally crying out to please, for the love of something or other, go get work done. I feel the stress pushing, pulling, howling in me, rising up like inner fire. And not going brings tears to my eyes, trembling to my limbs. It shouldn't be this hard. But right now, it is.

It is this hard because I believe that my true value comes only from showing up, from other people validating my work and my goodness and I almost can't stand ignoring the push to DO SOMETHING in order to work, for awhile, in solitude. Sure, I can work in solitude, jack in with my headphones a la The Social Network, as long as what I'm doing "matters", is expected, is earning money prestige moving things forward will be visible will ... like doing my homework as a kid. Nothing else really mattered. Not reading or writing or thinking or dancing or singing or building things ... nothing in my imaginary life (which was extensive and as a teenager, temporarily lugubrious) was matterful or visible. Sure, when a play or musical or chorus concert happened, maybe one of my family members would come (maybe) but ... the real me, the actual me was not the point, right? The got my homework done me, the got good grades so nobody worried about me me, that me who made everything seem fine (when it rarely was) me mattered.

Even people with a happy childhood, I imagine, understand what I'm saying. If not when young, perhaps as you got older. How expected you trumps you, actual. How the things that set your joy singing and your hair on fire only sometimes reveal themselves and meeting deadlines, paying bills makes you "good".

I no longer strive to be good. I have said this before. I loved Mary Oliver's poem that begins:
You do not have to be good.
You do not have to walk on your knees
For a hundred miles through the desert, repenting.
You only have to let the soft animal of your body
love what it loves."
I remember this for a time and then, I quit. I give in to the relentless pressure to attend to other people's needs in order to be safe, economically secure (enough), to raise a child to pay my mortgage to ...

And as I type this, I hear a chorus of people saying "oh, poor you, poor little you you have to take care of others instead of doing whatever the hell you feel like doing waaaah". I nearly drown in that sound. But you know what? I do need want to love and take care of others. Our nonhuman beings, my adult son and his girlfriend, my beloved, our home and land ... but you know what? I don't have to sacrifice my work and creativity and powerful deep need for learning and thinking and imagining in order to do so. As a matter of fact I shrink my ability to do so when I do.

Because solitude matters. the work we do when we focus on hearing our own expeerience, sit with our generative enregy, is what contributes something valuable tot he world. We live in a time when you are measured, spiritually and (kinda) economically by how you serve others. Which is valuable and of course, I'm glad there are doctors and nurses when I am ill. But that is not ALL of what we are - what we do. That isn't even all we should get paid for. We are complex beings, we contain multitudes. And if you are a doctor or a nurse - I certainly hope, pray, that you invest solitude time every week (day?) learning more about yourself and how to listen and be compassionate (to yourself and others), you write about how to help people and study in groups that help you become better at what you do. I hope you know that you are a walking work of art, constantly being created by *every single place* you put your attention. If you are an arrogant asshole, if you focus on power and prestige ... how will you help us? Who needs that?

Reading is the practice I rely on to remind me to solitude. Unplug, focus.

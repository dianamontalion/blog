This week, I am at odds with my surroundings.

## Inside of me

I have a mostly-clear picture, a strategic understanding, of the circumstances. At least, the aspect of the circumstances I'm tasked with understanding. And I'm relatively clear about their impact on me and our work. This understanding is consistently validated (or corrected) by others in similar situations or those who have similar experience.

I'm 78% comfortable saying that I see what's working and what's not -- what's okay to continue doing and what needs to change (if we want to meet our goals). I'm 67% confident that I'm trying to change the most-essential aspects, or at least, know where to begin.

There are a few others shining light on the remaining 12% and 33%. Thank goodness. They are also exposing aspects of the 78% and 67% that aren't correct. Feeling comfortable and confident doesn't mean I'm right. This work together builds trust. I have no attachment to being right, only desire to discover, uncover. (Okay, yes, there is a little attachment to being right, I am human. Being right feels good too. But so does being wrong when it leads to eventually being right so win/win there.)

Our blind spots, as always when facing uncertainty, make the circumstances tenuous, even when the confidence level is 100%. When blind spots are revealed, our understanding of the whole circumstance may change (or appear to). Some of our best possible solutions will suddenly be incorrect and unworkable. That's expected, in any situation, to some extent. I'm actively shining a light on my own ignorance. I'm failing, cause blind spots are blind, but when I stumble, will step up to consider again (and again) when this happens. (Not "if it happens", when.)

## Outside of me

Views are being expressed around me that are maddeningly out-of-synch with [see above]. Sometimes, we are solving very different problems and are tricked, for awhile, into thinking we are solving the same problems. We need to pause and do the harder work of identifying what matters most to focus on together. Commonality falls apart here, when we try to talk about the challenges holistically.

Sometimes, we don't agree on who gets to decide what "the problem" is.

Reframing the investigation works temporarily but then swirling eddies of side conversations happen and the process breaks down again. It isn't possible to create an integrated understanding if the communication patterns are disintegrated. The feedback when this is pointed out leans towards "that's an unreadable request."

Sometimes, we don't agree on who gets to be in the discussions (and view it as a role-based hierarchy challenge rather than a reasoning challenge.)

We see some things differently (reasonably) and some things differently (arguably, unreasonably). Unreasonableness blocks a shared view. It also blocks a view of itself. We believe we are being reasonable when we "try to get along", when we listen and speak with "reasonable" social politeness. We believe we can't be considered unreasonable if there is some rightness to our assertions.

This is not the case. Reason-able is the ability to give strong, sound and cohesive reasons for your views. And give empathetic and critical attention to other's reasons. Then, together, strengthen the reasons for a mutual view.  The mutual view can be "this is why we see this differently."

We suck at this, so we need to practice. We are human, we react instead of reason. We don't like to be vulnerable and this work pushes us into the "I don't know, let's see" space. It's hard and demands at least some psycholigical safety ground rules.

In this situation, the previously-established ground rules put tremendouse pressure on the communicator to be 100% responsible for the reactions, responses, feelings and thinking of the communicatees. You are wrong until "they" decide you are right. The communicator must make people understand and agree.

This doesn't create a shared view of anything. It leaves out the necessary and essential work required for mutual understanding. The mutual (non-forcefully induced or heirarchical) evolving experience of improving understanding together.

Nothing, no force on this earth, has the power to open a mind, or reveal an understanding to someone not asking the question in the first place.

The 67% identified Very Important Things that need attention are sometimes being dismissed, ignored. Which is normal (blind spots) expect for this Danger! Danger, Will Robinson! aspect: I'm told I personality defects that justify dismissing my input. Others (who don't agree with what needs to change) are amplifying the "truth". This gaslighting is not only crazymaking because it isn't true, it is an ad hominen fallacy -- attacking some aspect of the person who is making the argument rather than the argument itself. It's effective though because it buries the Very Important Things under a mountain of emotional labor.

The more a situation makes you feel like you MUST, SHOULD AND CAN effect change, fix others, the more it demends you manage the chaos towards some essential good ... the more likely it is to be unworkable. We are naturally drawn to helping during crisis times. But if someone doesn't see there is a crisis, the atomic power of all that "not knowing" force will come at you, like a tidal wave, like a freight train.

When we are working well with others to "know" things, it's more like swimming, paddling a canoe, riding bikes or hiking together. Managing people who continue to paddle off in different directions is rarely helpful if they aren't children.

## What is knowing

"Know" is a tricky word. It includes facts, yes, but also experience, pattern recognition (aka intuition), sound judgement and consideration of what you think and feel. It is what you know in your mind and what you sense in your physical body. Necessary doubt is valuable. Gaslit doubt (or doubt that isn't doubt but unwillingness to share a view) is destructive. Nothing complex or meaningful can be expressed so concretely that it can't be set on fire. When people fight about what they "know", they often don't define the word "know" the same way.

When I say "sense" or "intuition", I don't mean unvalidated psychic or emotional projection readings. I mean doing the work to bring something into focus until it is relatively clear to you. And more work brings you to the place even when the world around you doesn't mirror a shared view back. I wish that everyone had this exact type of "knowing" during the Jim Crow era, or when confronted with a 1950s American view of women or homosexuality. Systemic patterns are especially instransgient because they are so damn sure of themselves.

Whenever we intersect with other views, we are changed. Then we do the work to discern what to change, and intersect again. Often, we don't do this. We just push back (in myriad forms) on the other view. Talk to the hand, baby, talk to the hand.

In situations like this ... what do you trust?

When you experience patterns in the world (social and physical) around you that are causing harm, intentional or not, it can be difficult to articulate. You are a fish in language water, swimming in the same lake in which this is "normal". You know you are failing to bring people closer to where they say they want to go. You sense the gap, you hear it, you see it play out in discussions and political reactions and a breakdown in ability to get valuable things done. Blockers. When this harms you ability to do well by others or think well or focus (yourself and others) on what matters .... what do you do?

What do you trust?

Our culture is absolutely positively designed, constantly and in no uncertain terms, to push you to seek wisdom elswhere. What do you know? You don't know! Others (usually men) know. God (who is a man) knows. If you know differently, you don't yet understand correctly.

Experts know and if you pay them money they will share their knowing. (This is true and good! Not a given.) People who look like they know, (look like a doctor, for example), know. You know if the person you share your knowing with agrees with you.

This is especially forceful when the Group knows. This is why peer pressure is pressure. This is high school.

What if the person, the expert, the Group, the doctor or the C level executive doesn't know? (Cigarettes are good for your health, remember?) What does it mean when the thinking jangles against yours like a loose cowbell that nobody else seems to hear ringing?

Whatever happened to when we were kids saying "everyone else is doing it!" and we'd hear "if eveyrone jumped off a  bridge would you?" if we tried to argue that  What happened to that? What happened to the encouragement to practice discernment? To push against HARD cultural expectations as a measure of our goodness? Why doesn't JUST SAY NO apply to the CTO? The work processes that break people's spirits? The "strategic leadership" that is ... not strategic?

What do you do when you know better?

A mindfulness teacher once suggested that I have an 'aversion to delusion'. Isn't that ... what we hope for? How on earth do you craft wisdom for yourself without feeling that allergic reaction to thinking or behavoirs that are not wise? Don't we WANT delusion to set off alarm bells? Danger! Danger! Will Robinson!

I suspect the key word here is aversion. We aren't simply recognizing delusion, we are ... trying to make ourselves understood.

## Acceptance
You begin with accepting that it is so. Obvs, right? Nope! Pay attention and you'll likely discover that
